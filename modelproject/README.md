# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Solow Growth Model** and is about finding the steady-state levels of capital and simulating capital growth over time. As an extension, we include a parameter for rate of technological progress.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
